getting-started
===============

The repository contains examples of how to integrate with Google Genomics API. The code within each language-specific folder demonstrates the same things:
* Getting the read bases for NA12872 at specific a position
* Getting the variant overlapping that same position, and outputting the genotype

All languages will require a valid Client ID and Client secret.  If you have not already done so, follow the Google Genomics [sign up instructions](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/install-genomics-tools#authenticate) to generate and download a valid ``client_secrets.json`` file.

Copy the "client ID" and "client secret" values from that new credential, and follow your favorite language-specific README to run some code.
