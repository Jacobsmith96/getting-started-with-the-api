# Getting started in python

1. If you have not already done so, follow the Google Genomics [sign up instructions](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/install-genomics-tools#authenticate) to generate and download a valid ``client_secrets.json`` file.  

2. Copy the client_secrets.json file into this directory.

3. [Install pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html)

4. Install the python client library and run the code:

    ```
    pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
    python main.py
    ```
